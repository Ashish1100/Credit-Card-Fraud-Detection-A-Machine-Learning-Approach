> Empowering financial security through cutting-edge machine learning

CreditGuard is an advanced credit card fraud detection system that leverages the power of machine learning to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions.
## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. We analyze a dataset of credit card transactions, handle class imbalance, and implement various models to identify potential fraud cases.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore and preprocess credit card transaction data
- Handle class imbalance in fraud detection
- Implement and compare multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics
- Identify the most important features for fraud detection

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "creditcard.csv" file, which contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features have been transformed using PCA.

Dataset characteristics:
- 284,807 transactions
- 31 features (Time, Amount, V1-V28)
- Highly imbalanced: Only 0.172% of transactions are fraudulent

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
- XGBoost

## 📋 Project Structure

1. Data Loading and Exploration

   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
5. Feature Importance Analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download the "creditcard.csv" dataset and place it in the project root directory
4. Open and run the Jupyter notebook.


## 📊 Results

Our analysis shows that:
- XGBoost performed the best among all models tested
